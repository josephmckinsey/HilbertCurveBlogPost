- I have trouble importing ProofWidgets at the same time as Verso. There's some sort of syntax conflict between the div elements
that causes a compilation errors. I have no idea how to solve that, so I commented out that code and moved on with my life.

- I have no idea how to write a center div element, so I've resorted to separate definitions with the appropriate
style attributes, etc.

- I had to use #exit to quit the lean compilation so that I could type without serious lag.

- I wrote a custom script `transform_dollars.py` that I invoke from a VS-code extension "Edit With Shell Command" to convert Markdown LaTeX to normal code. I would like it something like this was automatic or whatever, because it's the only real difference I care about.
