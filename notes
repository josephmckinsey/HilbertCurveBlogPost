- I have trouble importing ProofWidgets at the same time as Verso. There's some sort of syntax conflict between the div elements
that causes a compilation errors. I have no idea how to solve that, so I commented out that code and moved on with my life.

- I have no idea how to write a center div element, so I've resorted to separate definitions with the appropriate
style attributes, etc.
